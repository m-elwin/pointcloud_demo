#+TITLE: ROS 2 Point Cloud Demonstration
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Elwin
* Overview
An example of processing point clouds using ROS 2 and C++, for users primarily familiar with python.
The =python/= subdirectory contains python code that used no-longer-maintained [[https://github.com/strawlab/python-pcl][python bindings for the PointCloud Library]].

The C++ code in this package aims to remain as close to the python example as possible, to enable comparison.

The code is designed for use with a Realsense D435i camera.
More information about setting up the system can be found at [[https://nu-msr.github.io/ros_notes/ros2/3dsensing.html][3D Sensing Notes]]
